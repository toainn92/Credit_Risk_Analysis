# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis to apply machine learning to sovle real-world challenge: credit card risk. Different techniques were employed to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In this anlaysis, RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms will be used to oversample the data, ClusterCentroids will be used to undersample the data. Then, a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling will be conducted with SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, the two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifer, to predict credit risk.
